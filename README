Description

Quick Plot is a Chicken module containing a collection of utilities (Scheme
procedures and macros) for generating 2D plots of data sets. The emphasis
is on data exploration and generating plots quickly in an interactive
environment (REPL), rather than creating publication quality plots.

Status
======

Quick Plot is in an experimental state. Breaking changes are likely to
occur. There may be critical bugs.
